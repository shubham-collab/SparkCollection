# SparkCollection

Hi,

This repo of mine contains codes(pyspark scripts) regarding various ways of ingesting data (from various sources), converting the data into dataframe and then applying vaiours joins, sorting etc to it.

I have ingested data from my local (Ubuntu) as data source, that's why have used ("file:/..). In some of the scripts i have used the source as HDFS.

In case of any issue/help regarding code, please contact.
